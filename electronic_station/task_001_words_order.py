"""
You have a text and a list of words.
You need to check if the words in a list appear in the same order as in the given text.

Cases you should expect while solving this challenge:

    a word from the list is not in the text - your function should return False;
    any word can appear more than once in a text - use only the first one;
    two words in the given list are the same - your function should return False;
    the condition is case sensitive, which means 'hi' and 'Hi' are two different words;
    the text includes only English letters and spaces.
