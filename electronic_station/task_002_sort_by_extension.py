"""
You are given a list of files.
You need to sort this list by the file extension.
The files with the same extension should be sorted by name.

Some possible cases:

    Filename cannot be an empty string;
    Files without the extension should go before the files with one;
    Filename ".config" has an empty extension and a name ".config";
    Filename "config." has an empty extension and a name "config.";
    Filename "table.imp.xls" has an extension "xls" and a name "table.imp";
    Filename ".imp.xls" has an extension "xls" and a name ".imp".
