"""
Your task is to find the angle of the sun above the horizon knowing the time of the day.
Input data: the sun rises in the East at 6:00 AM, which corresponds to the angle of 0 degrees.
At 12:00 PM the sun reaches its zenith, which means that the angle equals 90 degrees.
6:00 PM is the time of the sunset so the angle is 180 degrees.
If the input will be the time of the night (before 6:00 AM or after 6:00 PM),
your function should return - "I don't see the sun!".
